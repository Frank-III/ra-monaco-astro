## 🙏 Special Thanks

This project is almost a combination of these two awesome project: 

### [rust-analyzer-wasm](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer-wasm)
Special thanks to the rust-analyzer team for creating and maintaining the WebAssembly build of rust-analyzer. Their work forms the backbone of the intelligent code analysis features in this playground. The ability to run rust-analyzer in the browser has been instrumental in providing a rich development experience.

### [Rubri](https://github.com/LyonSyonII/rubri)
Huge thanks to [LyonSyonII](https://github.com/LyonSyonII) for creating Rubri, which served as a significant inspiration for this project.
